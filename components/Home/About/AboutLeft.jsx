            <p className='mt-1'>Hello,
                I am Onur, a graduate of Atatürk University with a degree in Management Information Systems. My journey with computers began when I was 7 years old, and my passion for technology has only grown since then. I am always eager to learn and constantly strive to improve myself.
                Currently, I specialize in Front-End development, with strong expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. During my university years, I gained valuable experience working as a Frontend Developer for nearly two years at tech park-based companies.
            </p>

            <p className='mt-1'> I continued my education with an intensive 4-month Frontend Bootcamp program at Turkcell Geleceği Yazanlar. Throughout this program, I collaborated with my team on over 20 projects. Additionally, I further honed my skills with a 66-hour in-person Frontend Development course at BTK Academy.
                The technologies I use include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Next.js, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, Flowbite, Sass, and Less. I am committed to continuous learning and self-improvement.</p>
